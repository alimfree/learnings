# Product Increment SAFE Agile planning

Today's second day of SAFE planning and today learned it's a cool way to flatten out an org so everyone has an idea of what others in an organization are workign on. 

There was pushback on dedicating devs to product planning and information gathering. I was introduced to the concept of "shovel ready". There was some planning that requested 5 fte devs to architect a solution that we plan to deploy in the future but CTO objected to giving back end dev resources to the project until shovel ready meaning the goals and objectives were agreed upon.

The goal of the meeting was to have a highlevel agreement on what key objectives we have as an organization.
