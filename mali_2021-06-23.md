#Using Sumo logic Compose, Subquery, and Parse

Parse allows finding logs that contain a string.

Compose used  with parse allows creating a list of values that match a given string. 

Subquery can be used to pass results of one query to a parent query. 

When reading it's easiest to start inner and move outer


<source app>
[subquery:
_sourceCategory=rails_api
and "Redirected to https://google.com"
[subquery:
  "#error" and
  _sourceCategory=mobile_app
  | parse "[CID:*]" as cid
  | compose cid keywords
]
| parse "[CID:*]" as cid
| compose cid keywords
]
  
Assuming we have two interdependent services rails api and mobile client, which share CID in the logs we are looking for all logs with errors in mobile client and then finding all redirects in the backend and finally getting all CID's for those sessions.
