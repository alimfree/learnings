# Image Formats 
[Source](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-dev-quiz/q26-image-formats/)


## Which of the following statements accurately compares different image formats?

A. JPEG supports both lossy and lossless compression and is known for its ability to retain contrast and luminosity in images.
B. PNG is preferred for its lossless compression and transparency features, making it ideal for logos, but it does not support progressive rendering.
C. WebP offers both lossy and lossless compression, supports transparency, and provides better compression than JPEG and PNG.
D. AVIF is known for its fast decoding and encoding capabilities and extensive browser support, but it does not support a high color range and wide color gamut.


### JPEG
- Lossy Compression - prioritizes image file size over quality. 
- Progressive Rendering - slowly an image becomes sharper as the page completes loading
- Faster Decoding - devices can decode and display images quickly without significant processing power

### PNG
- Losssless compression - doesnâ€™t get rid of any original data. Means can be larger file size.
- Transparency - supports transparency
- Excellent for logos. 

### WebP 
- Supports lossy and lossless compression.
- Supports transparency
- Progressive rendering - offers much better compression than previous two formats

### AVIF
- Supports lossy and lossless compression
- Supports high color range and wide color gamut - means pictures retain contrast, luminousity, and color -richness.
- Offers much better compression so file sizes are smaller.
- Decoding and encoding can take longer and there is not as much browser support yet.

More details

Good resource for converting files is [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/), they also have a cli tool which is great! 
Unfortunately the some features are no longer supported but its possible this project gets picked up by Open Source community.
