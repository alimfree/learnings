Image Formats

JPEG
Lossy Compression - prioritizes image file size over quality. 
Progressive Rendering - slowly an image becomes sharper as the page completes loading
Faster Decoding - devices can decode and display images quickly without significant processing power

PNG
Losssless compression - doesnâ€™t get rid of any original data. Means can be larger file size.
Transparency - supports transparency
Excellent for logos. 

WebP 
Supports lossy and lossless compression.
Supports transparency
Progressive rendering - offers much better compression than previous two formats

AVIF
Supports lossy and lossless compression
Supports high color range and wide color gamut - means pictures retain contrast, luminousity, and color richness.
Offers much better compression so file sizes are smaller.
Decoding and encoding can take longer and there is not as much browser support yet.


Good resource for converting files is [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/), they also have a cli tool which is great! 
Unfortunately the some features are no longer supported but its possible this project gets picked up by Open Source community.
