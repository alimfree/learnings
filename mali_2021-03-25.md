## Mimemagic gem changes

This week Mimemagic gem developers pulled the gem from ruby gems breaking builds that pull directly from rubygems. The developers also updated their license to GPL-2. Rails depends on Mimemagic and all rails shops that want to continue to use Mimemagic must now consider the license changes to their business. 

learnings, public companies should not pull from ruby-gems and should instead invest in having their own gems repository. 
Additionally, changes to dependencies and licenses will always happen. It's important to write your business logic so that future changes are not as difficult to manage.
