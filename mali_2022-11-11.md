#How to operate at a higher level


> “Well, in Amazon a L5 SDE is expected to deliver a project end to end independently. You would collect requirements and define the project scope, just like how you would plan a dinner. You would divide the project into milestones and get them done on expected dates, just like how you cook the dinner for your parents and serve them on time. You would get your project through operational readiness: set up metrics, alarms, dashboards and runbooks, just like how you would clean the table and dishes for your parents.”

< “A L5 SDE stops relying on others to clean up after their work. They think on behalf all the stakeholders: end customers, partner teams, business leaders, team members and oncall engineers. They deliver end to end, cover the whole spectrum of the project lifecycle.”
