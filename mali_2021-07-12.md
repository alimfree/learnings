# Moving faster with git using regex

Today I learned it's possible to use regex with git. Some interesting use cases are when viewing changes in a specific file

git status

```
$ git status
modified some/unnessarily/long/path/tickets/index.js
modified another/long/path/file.js
modified some/cool/README.md
no changes added to commit
``` 

Instead of typing or copy pasting the long path regex can shorten the text we need to type.

```
$ git diff "*/tickets/*"
outputs changes in tickets/index.js
```

Always pays to learn how to better use the tools of the trade.
