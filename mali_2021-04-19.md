## Turn off Eslint 

Linters and the rules a particular org uses whether it's adopted or created by the org is important in maintaining code quality. I often learn why a pattern or habit is bad because of the presence of the linter. We're using airbnb's rules via eslint.

Usually rewriting your code to conform to the linters rules is the best way to go but sometimes you may need to turn off linting for a single line.
