Cookie Policy Header

Domain attribute specified allows all subdomains of a given domain. If not only allows domain it was created by.

Secure means this cookie can only be transmitted by https.

httpOnly means we cannot access this cookie client side, but server can access it.

Same-site if not specified will default to lax meaning cookie will be sent to top level domains like www as well. Assumes https.
