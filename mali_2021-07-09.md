# Human Nature 

You are human. Comparing yourself to other devs/people is natural but the ill will that follows is optional. Envy and jealousy are not cool. When measuring yourself up to someone else or their accomplishments, remember you set your own pace and its entirely up to you to switch gears, work harder, and accomplish more.

It's easy to admire people from afar but changing your pace - improving is also optional.  Learn to move differently and resist the natural tendency to want what others have without working for it. 

Reminding myself these affirmations after discovering an internet stranger this evening. 
I stubled upon a super productive dev named Shawn Wang. 

Shawn is an interesting character with a prolific writing/coding habit. Check his github activity - years of consistency. A month doesn't pass without multilple publications on his personal site. 

Super impressive example of what hard honest work looks like.

Get after it.
