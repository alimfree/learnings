# Human Nature

You are human. Comparing yourself to other devs/people is natural but the feelings that come from that are all optional. It's healthy to level up with friendly competition but envy and jealousy are not cool. 

When measuring yourself up to someone else or their accomplishments remember to keep a clean heart. 

It's easy to admire people from afar but remember you set your pace. And its entirely up to you to switch up the gears, work harder, and level up. 
Today I learned about a super productive dev while peeping an indiehacker. 

Shawn Wang is an interesting internet stranger with a prolific writing/coding habit. It's awesome to see how far you can go if you move at Shawn's pace for multiple years. Check his github activity and notice how consistent it is. 
Then read some articles and check the timestamps. A month doesn't pass without multilple long articles. 

Super impressive example of what hard honest work looks like.
