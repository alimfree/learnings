c for everyone course

pre and post increment/decriment
a = 5
b = ++a vs c =  a++ 
b is assigned six after a is assigned 5 and incremented
c is assigned 5 and then a is incremented but c remains 5 after the operation. 

integers
long short and unsigned 

short has less intergers in range, long more. 

using short integers and using an operation like dividing can be either an integer or a floating point operation. Sometimes unexpectedly 3/7 results in 0

integers.c explained
format type affects how things are written %c displays the integer as a character, while %d prints as an integer.

Short divided by an int maybe missing the remainder eg 5/2 is 2
Short divided by float 2.0 is 2.5 

float gaurantees more numbers
double gaurantees as many integers as there are floats with as much significance as there are floats. 
a long double gaurantees as many doubles as there are on the machine and as much siginificance as there are doubles. 

significance 

.1 + 123e12)

this computation has no effect and == 123e12
(1/3) doesn't have same precision as 0.33

input/output
conversion %e or %E prints as 1.2345e+00 a +00 is a two digit number
%f prints as 1.23456
%g or %G either e or f - gives shortest representation depends on which is easier to print either %f or %E
