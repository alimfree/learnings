c for everyone course

pre and post increment/decriment
a = 5
b = ++a vs c =  a++ 
b is assigned six after a is assigned 5 and incremented
c is assigned 5 and then a is incremented but c remains 5 after the operation. 

integers
long short and unsigned 

short has less intergers in range, long more. 

using short integers and using an operation like dividing can be either an integer or a floating point operation. Sometimes unexpectedly 3/7 results in 0

integers.c explained
format type affects how things are written %c displays the integer as a character, while %d prints as an integer.

Short divided by an int maybe missing the remainder eg 5/2 is 2
Short divided by float 2.0 is 2.5
