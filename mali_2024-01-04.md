[Tabnabbing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing) is a malicious attack that allows a user's navigation to be hijacked when clicking a link on a site. The default behavior of modern browsers as of 2018 is to use the no-opener referral policy. The no-opener referral policy prevents links that are opened in a new tab from getting hijacked using this technique. In older browsers, when a user clicks on a link without this directive, the newly opened tab has access the the window.opener object and can explicity change the return location of the newly opened tab to any malicious site. So, when the user clicks back, their browser loads a new site that is not the original referring site.

A more strict referral policy is no-referrer which implicitly also uses the no-opener policy but also prevents sensitive query params or any additional url params from being accessible to the newly opnened tab. This is important to remember when working with sites that have users that maybe running older browsers. They may not have the latest most secure browser or browser versions. It's generally a good practice to include both no-refferrer and no-opener when the no-referrer directive is needed.

Both these referral policies are supported by http and https. The default referral policy for modern browsers is strict-origin-when-cross-origin which only includes the origin as the referrer instead of the entire url. This means the referrer location will not have any paths or query params in the url.
