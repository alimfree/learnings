## Git Revert

Some orgs have a policy to avoid changing git history. Often I'll want to undo specific commits. It's easy to undo changes without modifying git history. 

I have an alias on my machine for revert which takes a commit hash and undoes commits up until the given one. 

```alias revert='git read-tree -u --reset $1'```
