## Message request

I've decided to return to school. I remember you taking classes at CMU, do you have time this week to chat about your experience working and schooling? Also, I'm curious what goals you had when you were in graduate school and concentrations you would choose if starting a grad program today. 


Reasons to go to grad school 
How do logic gates work?
Transistors
How processes work through cpu
How microprocessor architecture affects software
Security at microprocessor level and high-level in the browser â€¨General security practices
Practical application of security. What is the strategy for finding vulnerabilities, what do the programs do and how to prevent vulnerabilities .
When designing a system whether processor or software hardware or software how to minimize security vulnerabilities. 
Data.
