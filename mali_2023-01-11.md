Performance testing and tradeoffs


 Performance testing is tricky, especially with modern js frameworks in the mix. Every layer in the architecture should be tested in isolation. So e.g., if you want to test the performance of your js app, it makes sense to mock all API calls, so you are really only testing the js. And then when you do true end-to-end testing, you want to do it on an isolated network. And then if you introduce parallelism, you're creeping into load testing territory.

There are now tools like scout for new relic that allow users to do the work of load testing.
