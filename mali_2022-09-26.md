Was asked to clean up sql to reduce redundant queries. 

Tips from guides.rubyonrails.org

## N+1 queries 

```
books = Book.includes(:author).limit(10)

books.each do |book|
  puts book.author.last_name
end

The above code will execute just 2 queries, as opposed to the 11 queries from teh original case.


## AND Conditions

I knew the n+1 query problem before but was requested to refactor one which used
 AND conditions. 

AND conditions for the logical intersection between relations can be built by calling "and" on the first relation, and passing the second one as an argument.

```
Customer.where(last_name: 'smith).where(orders_count: [1,3,5]))


equivalent to sql

SELECT * From customers WHERE customers.last_name = 'Smith' AND customers.orders_count IN (1,3,5)
```

Using AND 


```
Customer.where(id: [1,2]).and(Customer.where(id: [2,3]))

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (customers.id IN (1,2) AND
customers.id IN (2,3))
```

## More SQL Fun 

### Less than or Equal to 

Active record has its own private api, [Arel](https://apidock.com/rails/v6.0.0/Arel/Predications) for building sql queries. See related methods in link for more methods available. 

example of this method is lteq

```
Post.where(Post.arel_table[:published_date].lteq(Date.new(2015, 8, 11))
```

instead of 

```
Post.where('published_date <= ?', Date.new(2015, 8, 11))
```

### Equality

Compare two active record model's values 

```
Post.where(Post.arel_table(:published_date].eq('Sample Post'))

```

instead of 

```
Post.where('title = ?', 'Sample Post')
