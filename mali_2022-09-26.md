Was asked to clean up sql to reduce redundant queries. 

Tips from guides.rubyonrails.org

N+1 queries. 

```
books = Book.includes(:author).limit(10)

books.each do |book|
  puts book.author.last_name
end

The above code will execute just 2 queries, as opposed to the 11 queries from teh original case.
