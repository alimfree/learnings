# Rendering Layers

There are GPU accelerated properties that move layers to their own rendering layer. This allows elements to be animated and smoothly move independently of each other. Without this the browser would need to recalculate the positions and dimensions of elements, a reflow, and additionally repaint the layer. This results in a choppy lag or delay when gpu accelerated properties are not used. 

Position fixed needs to always stay in the same place within the screen so it makes sense to include this as its own layer. Dont focus on remembering what has its own layer but focus instead on knowing which properties cause animations or intuitively make sense to need their own layer. You can use dev tools to confirm which elements indeed have their own layer.

There are more than this list but here are some examples of gpu accelerated properties that always assign elements to their own layer.

### Examples

will-change: transform
position: fixed
Opacity
filter
Transform: translateZ(0)
backface-visibility: hidden
Will-change: opacity
<video>
WebGL <canvas>
Transform: rotateY(45deg)
