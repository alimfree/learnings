# Kubernetes duplicate http
Duplicate value: "http"

The issue was that for Kubernetes changing the port (which has a specific name) means having two ports with the same name (one is port 80, the other port 8080). Applying the change does not help while the port is 80, so I changed it manually to 8080 and ran build job again

kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/kubeconfig/file -n <faulty namespace> edit deployment <faulty app>
