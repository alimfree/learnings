# Frontend Guild learnings

We're having some issues with js dependency build times taking too long. 
One developer on my team introduced webpack dll. This allows the following.

- redundant js dependences are removed from builds
- allows for fewer and smaller js build files
- build times are faster because we use dll instead of compiling during build process

Also discovered a performance benchmarking to measure impact
