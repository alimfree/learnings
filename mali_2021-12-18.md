C for everyone first day notes

to compile
cc -o sample.exe sample.c

to run the file
./sample.exe

vim commands
r - to replace current value
:r test.c - reads in the file name test.c into current file 
cw - to replace current word


Dennis Richie 1941 - 2011
Creator of the C programming langauge at Bell Labs. Awarded turing award in computer science among other awards. He was also the co-author of Kernighan and Ritche C Programming Language book - the original authoritative text on C language. 

Dennis wrote C to help develop the unix operating system with Kenneth Thompson at Bell Labs. 

Characteristics of the language
- small ~ only 29 keywords
- low-level ~ highly efficient and access all of system resources
- efficient ~ easy to translate into machine code

C is often referred to as a system implementation language. C was preceeded by B, BCPI, and algol60. Prof Ior highly recommends looking at algol60 as many concepts still in use today started with algol60


Ior recommends K o R book on C. Ior's book is written for people already experienced in programming in other languages and is much thinner and condensed. 

Notorious first program. 

#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
  printf(
     "hello world\n"
  return 0;
}


- main is always used to signify the begining of the program.
- \n means advance to a new line
- return 0 is a special message to the os denoting we have completed the program. 
- notice matching quotes, and brackets to end the end of a string or a statement respectively.
- special characters and syntax are important namely semi colons. without which these characters the compiler will not be able to process the code. 


circile.c explanation
Directives in C
 - define allows to store values inside a preprocessor token which we name. 
 - { "open brace" braces enclose a compound statement
 - first declaration statement used initialize values
 - second statement prompts user with instructions
 - third statement will explain future in detail %lf refers to the address of the area variable. 
 - fourth statement use multiplication to calculate area
 - fifth print the area
 - return 0 to exit the program.


ch1-marathon-km explanation
 - # preceeds a  preprocessor command indicated by sharp
 - void means the argument list is empty.
 - int means the program returns an integer
 - { open brace means begin the code
 - */ ends a comment which is ignored by compiler
 - miles we use words as variable names which improves program literacy. 
 - double another keyword and is a type of number
 - kilometers is not an integer therefor 1760 must be in decimal to the tenths place to change kilometer into an int. int multiplied by an int is also an integer so this is ensures kilometers is a double and not an int. 
 - printf again is provided by stdio library and allows us to print another line.
