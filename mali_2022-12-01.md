## Mimemagic error

When you receive the following error

An error occurred while installing mimemagic (0.3.8), and Bundler
cannot continue.


Around March 2021 mimemagic repo was pulled from rubygems now you can use brew to add the dependency to most rails apps. 
 
```
$ brew install shared-mime-info
```
or if you dont want to update every package 

```
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install shared-mime-info
```
