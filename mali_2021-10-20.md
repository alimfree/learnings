Rollout and docker container expose port

rollout gem is awesome for versioning your releases and adding feature toggles into production so no rollbacks are necessary and on demand feature enable or disable is possible.


this is a nice shortcut to lower case a branch name
Assuming your branch name is the same as the story in jira or wherever, you can save a command to expose docker container for mysql to your local computer. In this case local port 3360 maps to docker container's 3306.  


br=`git branch --show-current | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`

sql(){
  eval "kubectl port-forward --context cluster --namespace ${br}  svc/mysql
 3360:3306"
}
