## React Hooks and Notes 

React Ref allows for interacting with a specific element on the dom. Use effect allows for running logic repeatedly or once as component loads. 

React Fragments avoid adding more than necessary nodes to dom but still group a list of children. 

Uncontrolled input vs controlled input applying onchange rules for example character count. Controlled inputs have state while uncontrolled do not have state.
